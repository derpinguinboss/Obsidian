Summary
---
- Also known as the "even-odd" [[Discrete Cosine Transform]].
- It's defined only for even-length signals.
- The DCT-I is not widely used in practical applications due to its less intuitive properties and complexity.
- It's primarily used for theoretical purposes and is not as popular as the other DCT types.
